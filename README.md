Head First Design Patterns
=====================
Strategy Pattern
---------------------
1. Coded the client, the abstract duck class. The swim behavior is constant and all ducks can swim.
2. The display behavior is overridden by each class implementing the duck abstract class.
3. The fly behavior and the quack behavior are changing and are removed from the duck implementation. They are coded as an interface.
